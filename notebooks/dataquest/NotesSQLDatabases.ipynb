    "\n",
    "A view is a virtual table containing the result of a saved `SELECT` statement, dynamically created once we query the view. In other words, a view encapsulates queries into a reusable database object to reduce repetitive work and maintain data integrity. Unlike a regular table, a view doesnât contain real data. However, like tables, we can query views and join them with other views or tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are beneficial because they allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hide Complexities:\n",
    "  One of the main reasons for using views is to simplify complex SQL queries; after the view query is implemented, we can reuse it without\n",
    "  knowing the details of the underlying query.\n",
    "* Ensure Data Security:\n",
    "  We can make our databases more secure by exposing part of tables instead of complete tables and granting access to particular subsets\n",
    "  instead of the entire tables.\n",
    "* Represent Data:\n",
    "  Views are a great way to change data format and represent the data differently from their underlying tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between views and CTEs (above):\n",
    "\n",
    "* A SQL view is a database object whose query is only stored in the database, not the data returned by the query. On the other hand, a CTE is not stored as an object in the database, which means the CTE's query exists in the memory while the query is executing and is discarded when the query execution finishes.\n",
    "* Although frequently used queries are ideal candidates for being implemented as views, we use CTEs for occasionally referenced queries.\n",
    "* SQL views can be used for data access management too. They restrict users from accessing a particular part of data while they can still use the information they need. CTEs don't provide this capability.\n",

    "* `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns row numbers 1, 2, 3, ... consistent with the ordering. If the ordering column is not unique, the assignment is non-deterministic.\n",

    "* `DENSE_RANK()`: Same as `RANK()`, but the rank sequence does not have holes. For the example above, we'd have 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6.\n",
